# FESpy - A Python Module for Computing Energy Surfaces
The following module is a key package used in my PhD research where the following physical information is computed using
the folding kinetics of a protein ($k_f$ the folding rate and $k_u$ the unfolding rate) and the PDB (protein data bank)
file of the structure of the protein.
